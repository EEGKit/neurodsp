Example and test data files for NeuroDSP.

The following data files are made available with the module, for use in the tutorials:
- `sample_data_1`: a segment of human primary motor cortex (M1)
    - Data sample is from a DBS device implanted in a patient with Parkinson's Disease
    - The data sample is 10 seconds from a single channel, sampled at 1000 Hz
    - For more information on the data, see Cole et al, 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2208-16.2017)
- `sample_data_1_filt`: same data as `sample_data_1`, that has been filtered in the beta range
- `sample_data_2`: a segment of rat hippocampal LFP data
    - The data sample is 150 seconds from a single channel, sampled at 1000 Hz
    - Data file is from the publicly available 'hc2' dataset from CRCNS (https://crcns.org/)
    - For more information on the data, see Mizuseki et al, 2012 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.2894)
